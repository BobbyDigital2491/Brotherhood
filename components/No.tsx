          Our focus is on the perception of our youth. We look forward to teaching them the power 
          of their mind, an understanding of finances, what it takes to be an entrepreneur, and the 
          power of togetherness and unity. The perception of our communities as of lately call 
          attention to unemployment, poverty, crime and brutality; which often overshadow the more 
          positive trends in the community. The Elite Brotherhood Program’s core values center on 
          young men obtaining sustainable wealth opportunities for themselves and their families. 
          That wealth will be attained through a mental and physical understanding of freedom. 
          We will assist young men to not only be innovators and to think as leaders, but also 
          understand that strong individuals make strong families, strong families make strong 
          communities, and strong communities make change. With a positive understanding that we 
          must insert ourselves into this complex society in order to be the change for Charlotte 
          and the world.{" "}

          <p className="max-w-lg text-xl ">
          Totally disturbed by the disproportionate number of black millionaires in the US, 
          Jeremy has decided instead of making excuses for this inequity, he will make a difference.
           Using the knowledge he has gained through research, this young men has decided to create a
            youth development program, The Brotherhood Academy, in hopes to eventually open the 
            nation's first African American Entrepreneurship Leadership Academy. This will be a 
            school whose core values will center on young men obtaining sustainable wealth 
            opportunities for themselves. "We want to help young people learn how to be innovative 
            and think," says Burris.
            <br/><br/>
            "Teach them to use proven strategies to create business ideas to positively impact our community and people." The Brotherhood Academy, currently in its incubation stage, plans to start our quest for change by starting with a YEAR ROUND after school program in Charlotte, that will begin to get young people fired up about "owning their own wealth and creating their own businesses. " By using the resources from like-minded people and partner organizations, this program will help change the mindset of our young people, being able to distinguish between being rich and being wealthy."
            <br/><br/>
            "We want to ultimately resurrect a "modernized" Black Wall Street, modeling that of Tulsa Oklahoma before 1921!" says Burris. Jeremy is able to recite statistics that he wants to combat. "With high school graduation rates for black males plummeting -and the school to prison pipeline ever so prevalent, The Brotherhood Academy is ready to respond." "Owning only 7% of US businesses is just not good enough! We truly must change the narrative and mentor our young men into success, and really show them what wealth and success looks like."
            <br/><br/>
            "We want to help young people learn how to be innovative and think,". Not only teaching young men about the power of money and what it takes to be an entrepreneur but, teaching them how transfer that power to navigate society. "When you hear about inner city communities you only hear about unem-ployment, poverty and crime which often overshadows the more positive trends in the community. We want an entrepreneurial mindset to be the new "sports league or record label deal," ... where everyone wants one!" "It starts with us!" says these two. "Individuals make families, families make communities and communities make change, we must insert ourselves into this mix and be that change for Charlotte and the world!" If you will like to join forces with these young men, or to find out ways you can help please contact The Brotherhood Academy.{" "}

            “ As an advocate for the youth, more specifically young men of color, I strive towards the restoration and development of their emotional intelligence. Often times we are instructed to suppress our emotions as a result of the events we face within our marginalized communities. I stand in the belief that with a proper understanding of one’s self and environment, we can tear down the current beliefs and stigmas that we as men of color face when dealing with such issues. I stand on the core values of love, free expression, and community. You can catch me in my free time reading, running, practicing yoga, meditating, gaming, or watching anime.”{" "}
